# CLI Proxy API

English | [中文](README_CN.md)

A proxy server that provides OpenAI/Gemini/Claude/Codex compatible API interfaces for CLI.

It now also supports OpenAI Codex (GPT models) and Claude Code via OAuth.

So you can use local or multi-account CLI access with OpenAI(include Responses)/Gemini/Claude-compatible clients and SDKs.

## Getting Started

CLIProxyAPI Guides: [https://help.router-for.me/](https://help.router-for.me/)

## Management API

see [MANAGEMENT_API.md](https://help.router-for.me/management/api)

## Amp CLI Support

CLIProxyAPI includes integrated support for [Amp CLI](https://ampcode.com) and Amp IDE extensions, enabling you to use your Google/ChatGPT/Claude OAuth subscriptions with Amp's coding tools:

- Provider route aliases for Amp's API patterns (`/api/provider/{provider}/v1...`)
- Management proxy for OAuth authentication and account features
- Smart model fallback with automatic routing
- **Model mapping** to route unavailable models to alternatives (e.g., `claude-opus-4.5` → `claude-sonnet-4`)
- Security-first design with localhost-only management endpoints
